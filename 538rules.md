# FiveThirtyEight Presidential Endorsement Tracker | Overview & Rules


## Why we created these markets

As the 2020 election season is already in full swing, the world is eager to see which candidates voters will choose to lead the United States. The first contest we at the 2020 project are focused on is the race to be the Democratic Party's nominee for President of the United States. 

We look forward to another exciting primary season and our team will be working hard to provide our community with a wide range of markets that track each candidate's performance in the political horse race. We look forward to your participation and encourage community members to reach out with questions, feedback and suggestions. 

## Why are we creating markets for the FiveThirtyEight Endorsement Primary Tracker? 

Elections are full of uncertainty and fortunes can be altered in a moments time. The 2020 Project set out to explore data-driven ways to measure each candidate's standing in real time, before any votes are cast. The endorsement tracker created by the team at FiveThirtyEight is one of many indicators we can employ to assess the Democratic candidates in real time. The FiveThirtyEight methodology (outlined below) should provide clear and understandable guidelines for market participants and their tracker is updated regularly.
