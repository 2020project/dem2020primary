**Resolution Details:** The final point total will be listed on the [FiveThirtyEight website](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-endorsements/democratic-primary) and locked in as of `[HOUR]`:`[MINUTE]` `[AM / PM]` `[TIME ZONE]` on `[DATE]`.

As updates to the tracker on FiveThirtyEight.com do not occur on a pre-scheduled basis, the market will consider the numbers posted in the latest update that occurs before `[HOUR]`:`[MINUTE]` `[AM / PM]` `[TIME ZONE]` as the final point total. In this [dedicated website](https://2020project.github.io/dem2020primary/538biden), the designated reporter will screenshot the FiveThirtyEight website and download the most up-to-date CSV file to provide backup should the reporting come under dispute.
